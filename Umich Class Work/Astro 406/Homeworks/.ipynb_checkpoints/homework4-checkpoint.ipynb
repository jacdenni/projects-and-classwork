    "1. Run bootstrap realizations of the sample until the estimation of all model parameters converges.  Specifically, accumulate large enough bootstrap distribution that the standard deviation of model parameters $a$, $b$, $\\sigma$ <b>each</b> converges to (that is, varies with repeated bootstraps by less than) 0.001.  Note how many realizations each of the parameters required to converge.  Which required the largest number? <i>(Note that it is not the same criterion as I used in the class notebook.)</i><p>\n",

Calculate confidence limits for each model parameter $p = \\{a,b,\\sigma\\}$, that is, the range $p_{mean} \\pm dp$ containing a given percentage (confidence level CL) of the bootstrap distribution.  Write a routine where CL is an argument. Calculate $dp$ for the 68.3% and 90% confidence levels. <b>Extra points</b> if you base the routine on the distance of points to the mean along the covariance ellipse, that is, taking into account the difference in standard deviations of the parameters and their correlation."
