    "The answer depends on what we know and what we want to achieve.  If we know absolutely nothing about the origin of our data points (how they were obtained, what they represent), then we go for straight lines as in the example above.  It is called 'linear interpolation' and is the most basic, and robust, way of estimating the value of $y$ between the data points.\n",

    "\n",
    "The blue line corresponds to a spline function that guarantees a continuous second derivative of the interpolating function.  The idea behind splines is to add a cubic polynomial to a linear function, such that $y'' = d^2y/dx^2$ varies linearly between each neighbor pair of data points $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, and the first derivative $y' = dy/dx$ is continuous across the data points.  It turns out that there is an (almost) unique solution that satisfies these requirements.  Almost unique because $y''$ needs to be specified at the two end points; these are usually set to zero, enforcing linear interpolation beyond the range of available data.  It makes sense - we should never use non-linear extrapolation.\n",

    "The UnivariateSpline routine first calculates the fixed coefficients corresponding to the values of $y''_i$ and stores them as an array.  This completely specifies a simple (third-order in $x$) analytical function that describes our data throughout the whole interval of data.  We can then evaluate this function at as many locations as we need without having to repeat the polynomial fit, as in the interp1d routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional advantage of using spline interpolation is that we can integrate or differentiate the interpolating function analytically, and similarly evaluate $\\int y(d) dx$ or $dy/dx$ at any location.  Without any extra calculation!  In fact, it is one of the most convenient ways to evaluate a derivative of a function known only at discrete points.  The UnivariateSpline routine provides the functions to do it.\n",
